# OverView

Hello and Welcome to my Registration Application. This application is designed to register groups and members to a group. On the webpage you will be able to navigate to see Activities based on gender for kids. This is a work in progress and maybe missing some features.

# Setup

The first steps to set this up is you want to create two separate shells in terminal.
First is a client shell and the next a server shell in terminal. You can right click and rename them to make it easier to keep track.

## Step 1

- In the client shell type `npm install` and hit enter. This makes sure the app has everything we need.
- After that is finished running, then type in `ng serve` and hit enter.
- This will get the application up and running on `http://localhost:4200/`.
- You will then want to ctrl + click on that link and it will open a webpage in your browser.

## Step 2

- In the server shell, type `node server.js` and hit enter. You should see it say "App listening at port 8082". This will get the backend api we have to run to get data.

# At this point everything should be up and running
